[Skip to the crux](#scrummy)
### Bugzilla
When I started working with [Certify](http://www.certifydatasystems.com/), the company was using 
[Bugzilla](http://bugzilla.org/). Bugzilla as you might already know is one of the oldest Bug 
tracking tools around. However Project Management was not something built into Bugzilla. So Project 
Managers ended up using a variety of tools - Excel, Powerpoint, and finally *Microsoft Project*. 
However the problem with all of these is that collaboration takes a huge hit. And if anything is 
too hard to do regularly, the first group of people to avoid it will be programmers.

### JIRA with Greenhopper
Also my project manager wanted to know what's happening from Bugzilla, so I wrote a couple of 
queries and a single JSP app that converted that data into reports. Follow up requests made the 
single JSP evolve into a complex reporting app. I realized I was wasting too much time on this, and 
suggested [JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview). Given their $10 per piece of 
software deal, it wasn't hard to sell it to the project managers and upper management. Coupled with 
*Greenhopper*, JIRA is pretty good.

### Scrum and SaveThePostits
Some time later, a new manager came in, and said, we'll do 
[scrum on a board](http://www.totalattorneys.com/impacthouse/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/SB-1b.jpg) 
with post it notes. That was an amazing idea. However, I was unhappy at the waste of Post It Notes. 
*And* the fact that this was in addition to doing stuff on JIRA. *And* the fact that our office was 
weirdly shaped. Our office is shaped like a horseshoe, not intentionally, but because we grew 
organically to such a size. Engineers are on one side of the horse shoe, while the sales, business 
analysts and support staff are on the other, with the coffee machine in the middle. One important 
thing that an engineering team has to do is tell the rest of the company that while they don't make 
much noise, they're silently building cool stuff. This meant the scrum board had to be in the 
middle of the office, so engineers have to walk far enough to move those postit notes around. So I 
came up with [SaveThePostits](https://github.com/rahulsom/savepostits-jira). A 46" (My sincerest 
apologies to metric nazis!) tv and an unused e-machine later we got rid of the scrum board.

### Rallydev
While JIRA was great for developers, given it's amazing IDE integrations, and powerful API, it was 
not quite the right tool for product and project managers. So a couple of months later we gave in to 
the manager's demands that we move away from JIRA to a tool that is really built for Scrum. And that 
tool was [Rally](http://www.rallydev.com/). Unfortunately Rally has a terrible API. While it uses 
REST instead of JIRA's SOAP, you just need too many API calls to render something like *SaveThPostits*. 
I did implement SaveThePostits for Rally, but given the number of API calls, it was not as responsive 
as the JIRA version. Also Rally's product was not quite usable in my opinion. As time passed my 
complaints with Rally kept increasing.

### Scrummy
I had learnt enough about project management to decide to write my own tool - 
[Scrummy](https://github.com/rahulsom/scrummy). It aims to be simple to use, designed for Scrum, and 
responsive. Around the same time, I learnt about [Meteor](http://meteor.com/). That became my tool of 
choice. The ideas is there are certain tasks that happen all the time and the UI should focus on them.
* Anyone allowed[1](#allowed) to have ideas, creates stories.
* The Product Manager moves stories into milestones.
* The Team looks at the unplayed stories from the top and assigns them estimates.
* The Project Manager moves stories into iterations.
* The Team splits up stories among members.
* Each engineer splits their story into tasks.
* The owner of each task works and completes tasks.
* Everyone comments on stories and tasks and puts pictures of cats and dogs in them.

3 most dangerous things - A programmer who carries a soldering rod, a manager who writes code, and a 
user who has ideas.

You shouldn't have 15 fields to fill to create a story. That is how I expect scrummy to be. 
People who use this day in and day out don't want to use the mouse to do things. There should be 
keyboard shortcuts to make it simple to do most of the things.

Relevant related information should be available without having to click around. e.g. *Tasks under a 
story when looking at a story, or comments on a story*
