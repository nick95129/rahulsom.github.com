The first thing you're taught when you start learning physics is
> If you can't measure it, you can't do anything about it.

#### When cycling
I applied that approach to cycling - I bought a 
[Schwinn](http://www.amazon.com/Schwinn-SW654-6PK-20-Function-Computer/dp/B000DZD3FQ) computer and then a
[Cateye](http://www.amazon.com/Cateye-CC-RD400DW-Wireless-Cycling-Computer/dp/B002HHQNL4/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1340683375&sr=1-1&keywords=double+strada) and this made me understand my biking better. I knew 
how fast I could go, what my speed was on flats, climbs and descents. With Schwinn, I had an understanding of
how many calories I burnt. With Cateye, I started looking at my cadence.

#### When not cycling
However seasonal allergies brought my biking to a halt. And my fitness started declining again. So I decided to 
sign up for a gym membership - I hate using treadmills and stationary bikes.
> If I'm walking or biking for 5 minutes, I expect to be farther away from where I started. If I'm not, I get bored.

However I've come to terms with the fact that, the gym is the only way I can get back to being fit if I can't
get my miles when pollen is high.

As part of a goodie bag at a <del>race</del> 
[ride](http://www.active.com/cycling/yountville-ca/napa-valley-tour-de-cure-2012) I attended this year, I got a 
pedometer from the good folks at Walgreens. It's terrible in terms of accuracy and discreetness. One day, I did
nothing more than driving to work and returning home; and it said I'd walked 5 miles. And it's noisy; my colleagues thought
I was tin-foil carrying a Geiger Counter with me. Also pedometers don't account for other activity I do.

#### The choices
I saw my trainer at the gym wearing one of those [Bodybuggs](http://www.bodybugg.com/). That seemed like a good idea.
Except that you require a subscription to get the best out of it. So I've started looking at other alternatives

* [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com/product) seems to do away with the subscription, but it's just a 3D accelerometer;
  *that's like a fancy pedometer*. It's great in that it has an [API](http://dev.fitbit.com/), and apparently a 
  thriving ecosystem.
* Then there's Nike's [Fuelband](http://www.nike.com/fuelband/) which looks great, but then doesn't give any meaningful
  metrics other than it's own fake currency.
* The third contender is [Basis](https://mybasis.com/) which so far seems to be vaporvare, in that we don't know much
  about it except for that it will cost $199.

Here's what I'm looking for in the device:

* Either has either an API or a means to download data to my computer.
* Measures my activity and gives meaningful metrics.
* Lets me look at data in fine grained durations so I can compare past performance.

#### What does it mean to have an API?
It means that I do not have to pay money to someone so they can gather up my data, and sell it to someone else. My
fitness data is my Protected Health Information. I don't want to pay someone $10 a month so they know 
when I've been pumping iron and have my information sent to the makers of 
[Muscle Milk](http://www.cytosport.com/products/muscle-milk) and when I'm sleeping on my couch for 3 days in a row, 
send it to [Nutrisystem](http://www.nutrisystem.com/jsps_hmr/home/index.jsp?_requestid=594177). I would love something
like good old Nike+ which merely synced with your iPod and if you chose to, shared it on their website. However it looks
like everyone is taking the cloud seriously and there aren't any products in this category that work that way. I may be
wrong here, but that's what everyone's advertising looks like.
