At the crux of Healthcare IT, is a body called Integrating Healthcare Enterprise [(IHE)](http://www.ihe.net/). They are one of the standards bodies in healthcare. They organize this little thing in Chicago every winter called [Connectathon](http://www.ihe.net/connectathon/).

It is no secret that my opinion of healthcare technology is very bad. However [I am not alone](http://ihememes.tumblr.com/). Keep calm and carry on!

If you are into healthcare and want to talk to the nice folks from [@CertifyData](https://twitter.com/CertifyData), we'll be there. And if I may add, it'll be easy to find us.
