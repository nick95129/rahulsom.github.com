Experience

**Certify Data Systems (San Jose CA)**
Senior Developer
*Jul 11–Present*

I joined full time to start working on the new platform at Certify - HealthLogix, the common platform to service all 
types of customers Certify had - labs, hospitals, clinics and payers. This was Certify’s move away from data transfer, 
and to the HIE & analytics space.

This project was built with Groovy, Grails, Atmosphere, Camel, CXF at its core. I built a reverse push mechanism to have
customers within networks without public addresses connect to those which do have one.

This product, post acquisition became the Swiss Army Knife at Humana - it was the plumbing for getting all systems at 
different sites to talk to each other; but also became what Humana used as part of it's *Accountable Care Organization 
(ACO)* and *Managed Services Organization (MSO)* tools.

I reworked build system to use *job-dsl* and *Jenkins*. I automated the setup of developer laptops using boxen and later
did the same for servers using puppet.

**Certify Data Systems (San Jose CA) - Employee of Intelliswift Software Inc**
Java Developer
*Apr 08–Jul 11*

I started off with evaluating different choices we had, and then started building the Certify Gateway and Certify 
HealthDock™ with Spring, JPA/Hibernate based on AppFuse.

I implemented a Jython interface for dynamic customization of HL7 data. I built a JNLP-Swing client to integrate with 
Electronic Medical Record (EMR) vendors who needed filesystem based IO. I built JMeter tests to identify performance 
problem spots and performed several optimizations to the code to gain better performance.

**PRI Network (Warrendale PA) - Employee of Intelliswift Software Inc**
Java Developer, eAuditNet
*Feb 08–Apr 08*

Performance Review Institute Network was a part of the Society of Automotive Engineers. They were bringing component 
vendors and manufacturers together and managing reviews through eAuditNet. I worked on Spring and Hibernate to build 
reporting modules in this project.

I realized that moving data across environments was very slow because the BAs and DBAs would have to work together and 
trace all dependencies when moving data from each row in the table a developer would request for data. I built a jdbc 
tool that would do that job and print out sql queries to a file that anyone could use to accomplish this.

**Infosys Technologies Ltd (Bangalore INDIA)**
Software Engineer
*Nov 05–Jan 08*

Infosys Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ: INFY) is one of the biggest outsourcing companies in the US and India. I worked for 
Travelers Life and Annuities (post acquisition by MetLife) while there. I worked on some Mainframe projects and some 
Java projects.

I developed a COBOL module to let the Business Analysts merge their test data along with the data from several systems 
into the complex plumbing of modules on the Mainframe. I also developed a Visual Basic based tool to help in static 
analysis of COBOL code.

I worked with a reverse engineering team to parse COBOL code and convert it to data flow graphs using Java. I later 
worked for a Java project running on distributed computers, where I built a Swing tool to monitor the remote components,
and start/stop software on them.

**WhitePlast (Coimbatore INDIA)**
Software Engineer
*May 05–Oct 05*

White Plast was a small business using several different products for each of their operations. This meant a lot of 
duplication of data, and inconsistencies in their systems. Also significant repeated tasks were being performed 
manually. I helped them build a one stop for viewing all the data they had, and built a couple of tools that would help 
them get over their manual tasks. I used ASP, IIS and Microsoft SQL Server for most of my work here.

For the past few years I've been taking up a lead role in technical teams to produce outstanding business results. I'm 
proud of the competencies listed below in particular:

**Training;** I can learn new technologies very quickly and have a good working knowledge of many technologies. That 
helps me understand how people with different backgrounds look at technology, and effectively help them bridge the gap
between technologies they've used in the past and the ones that they may require for newer projects.

**Recruitment;** Lots of experience interviewing and testing for various technology roles; interviewed several 
candidates for Certify and Intelliswift.
